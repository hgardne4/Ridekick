Project Ridekick: Henry Gardner, Gabby Novack
CSC261 Final Project Milestone 3
Prof. Zhupa

How to run:
This project is being locally hosted for ease of development before release. We are hosting with PHP's built-in webserver. First make sure you are in the src directory and then execute the following command:

	php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

After executing this command, something similar to the following will result in the output:
PHP 7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.11 Development Server started at Wed Apr 13 16:31:13 2022
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Document root is /home/henryg30/Desktop/Ridekick/src
Press Ctrl-C to quit.

The "Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000" line contains a live link that can then be used to open and run the project. This will open the idex.html or index.php file (in our case it is the index.html file)
